                            <p class="card-text"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he name cookie is derived from the
                                Dutch word koekje. According to
                                culinary historians, the first historic record of cookies was their use as test cakes. A
                                small amount of cake batter was baked to test the oven temperature.<br> As people
                                started to
                                explore the globe, biscuits became the ideal traveling food, because they stayed fresh
                                for
                                long periods. Hardtack proved a portable food that had a long storage life and was
                                perfect
                                for traveling. <br>For centuries, a shipâ€™s biscuit, an iron-like cracker, was aboard any
                                ship
                                that left port because it could last for months.</p>

                                statement is not easy. It must be concise, accurate and inspiring. We knew there had to

                                something about great tasting cookies in the mission statement, but we wanted to be a

                                more than that. After all, cookies are not produced in a vacuum. It's really about
                                people:
                                the people who make the cookies, the people who eat the cookies and the community it
