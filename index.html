                        <p class="card-text">The name cookie is derived from the Dutch word koekje. According to
                            culinary historians, the first historic record of cookies was their use as test cakes. A
                            small amount of cake batter was baked to test the oven temperature.<br> As people started to
                            explore the globe, biscuits became the ideal traveling food, because they stayed fresh for
                            long periods Hardtack proved a portable food that had a long storage life and was perfect
                            for traveling. <br>For centuries, a shipâ€™s biscuit, an iron-like cracker, was aboard any
                            ship
                            that left port because it could last for months.</p>

                            statement is not easy. It must be concise, accurate and inspiring. We knew there had to be
                            something about great tasting cookies in the mission statement, but we wanted to be a little
                            more than that. After all, cookies are not produced in a vacuum. It's really about people:
                            the people who make the cookies, the people who eat the cookies and the community it
                            creates.</p>
